Hi, I'm Sam, a full stack developer and solutions architect from Portland, ME. I'm currently working for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and finishing up my final year at the University of Vermont studying Computer Science & Information Systems. Besides programming, I love to eat 🍳 and travel ✈️ whenever time allows.
